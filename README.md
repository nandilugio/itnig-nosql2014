TSDB section
------------

The conference started with Time Series Database talks. Ellen Friedman started the conference with her keynote ÎÎSeeing with your eyes closedÎÎ. This technology is not something new in fact, Ellen told us a bit about time series data ancient usage for logging wind, temperature and currents measures to help sailors for navigation.

Ted Dunning followed with his talk ÎÎVery High Bandwidth Time Series Database ImplementationÎÎ and introduced OpenTSDB: a scalable, distributed Time Series Database. The Internet is changing and ,as an example, our mobile devices have a lot of sensors which are storing lots of data over the time. We need specialized systems to handle this amount of data and NoSQL databases have a lot of terrain to explore and improve.

Quick highlights
----------------

As a quick highlights, after two years Riak 2.0 is out with a new search engine. Now, this key-value database is more interesting than ever, powered with a full distributed search combined with Solr.
Building a Startup with NoSQL seems to be totally possible but we must focus on picking the right tool for the job. Testing different alternatives is useful but we must think agile and be pragmatic.
When talking about Big Data you must be aware you are going to handle a huge amount of data. If you are using python take a look at pandas.DataFrame.
